			<span class="about_text_raw"><h2 class="about_person_title blue_text">Meet Elden Loomes</h2><p>Elden Loomes is a PhD physics student,
				contemporary classical composer and all-round nerd, like his father.<br><br>He writes an eclectic range of music, particularly
				specialising in works for large orchestra, and&mdash;at the other end of the scale&mdash;contemplative works for solo cello. When not working
				on these he might help around the house with some music for Syrinscape, for whom he has written a modest respectable collection.
