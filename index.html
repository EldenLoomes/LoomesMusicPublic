							Benjamin Loomes studied composition with Peter Sculthorpe, Anne Boyd, and Ross Edwards at the University of Sydney.
							He has composed a large number of instrumental and vocal works, including two operas, orchestral and concert band music,
							chamber music, choral music and art song, and solo works specifically written for graduating performance from senior high school. <br><br>He has received
							numerous commissions from schools, arts organisations, professional ensembles, and Ars Musica Australis. <br><br>
							He draws inspiration from the compositions of Britten, Shostakovich &amp; Prokofiev, P&auml;rt, and Poulenc. <br><br>
							As a singer Benjamin has performed many times as chorus with Opera Australia, the professional vocal ensemble Cantillation,
							and as soloist with smaller companies, including Pinchgut Opera. <br><br>Benjamin is the founder and CEO of <a href="https://www.syrinscape.com">Syrinscape</a>,
							an international company bringing immersive sound and a movie-like musical score to tabletop roleplaying and board games. <br><br>
							Ben bases himself in Sydney, Australia where he lives with his wife Karen, and two resplendent children, but spends as much time as
							possible in their house in Kangaroo Valley, a place of superb natural beauty and extreme quietude, which has inspired many a melody.

						<span class="about_text_raw"><h2 class="about_person_title blue_text">Meet Elden Loomes</h2><p>Elden Loomes is a PhD physics student,
							contemporary classical composer and all-round nerd, like his father.<br><br>He writes an eclectic range of music, particularly
							specialising in works for large orchestra, and&mdash;at the other end of the scale&mdash;contemplative works for solo cello. When not working
							on these he might help around the house with some music for Syrinscape, for whom he has written a modest respectable collection.<br><br>
							Elden ranked 2nd in the state in HSC Music 2, and now works with high-school music classes, including running composition workshops and composing commissioned works for senior performance exams.<br><br>
							Elden plays cello in the Sydney Youth Orchestra Flagship, and has recorded works (his <a href="./work?work=Symphony%20in%20B%20-%20of%20Love%20and%20War%20-%20No.%203">Symphony in B</a> and
							<a href="./work?work=Scherzo">Scherzo</a>) with the SYO Philharmonic.<br><br>
							He is currently (well Jan 2024-ly) listening to a lot of Eleanor Alberga and Alfred Schnittke, though will always fall back to some
							good-ol' Shostakovich.<br><br>You can check out a bunch of his stuff on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvKDxtij3sp_t482HkIZf1Q">Youtube</a>.</p></span>
